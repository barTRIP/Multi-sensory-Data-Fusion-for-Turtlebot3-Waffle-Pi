# Multi-sensory-Data-Fusion-for-Turtlebot3-Waffle-Pi

This is a thesis project for the obtention of the Master In Engineering Sciences. 

Several upgrades were made to the turtlebot3 to withstand the workload required by the data fusion algorithms.

1. Replace the included Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 Gb version for smoother operation) with active cooling. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089ZZ6DN5/ref=twister_B07Y5L1HCV?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

2. Attach the RealSense D435 3D Camera to the front of the robot using a 0.25 in width bolt with rubber bands as cushions to the aluminum case.
